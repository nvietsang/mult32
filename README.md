# Multiplication with only 32-bit variables

This repository implements the multiplication of two 32-bit positive integers by using only 32-bit variables (without using 64-bit variables).

For the details of the method, we refer to this blog post [Multiplying two 32-bit numbers without using 64-bit variable](https://nvietsang.github.io/2023/08/15/Mult32.html).

To run the test:

```
>>> make
>>> ./main
```
